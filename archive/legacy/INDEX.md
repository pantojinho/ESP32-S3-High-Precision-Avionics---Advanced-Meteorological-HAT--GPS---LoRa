# Legacy Archive Index

Last update: 2026-02-11

## Origin

This archive comes from the former `Projeto Antigo/` folder.

## Purpose

Preserve all historical references (firmware, KiCad, gerbers, datasheets, media)
without mixing them with the active HAT v1 workstream.

## Main content groups

1. `Projeto_Antigo/Tiny Water Station Mobile/`
- Prior hardware references
- Prior firmware references
- Third-party library footprints/symbols

2. `Projeto_Antigo/*.png|*.jpeg|*.xlsx`
- Visual references and old BOM files

## Policy

1. Do not add new active files here.
2. If a legacy artifact is reused in v1, copy it into `hardware/hat_v1/`
   and document that decision in `docs/project/PROJECT_MEMORY.md`.
